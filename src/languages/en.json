    "skidpad":"Skidpad",
    "skidpad-desc":"Assess the car's lateral grip and cornering capabilities. The car navigates a figure-eight course marked by two circles in opposite directions. The time taken to complete the course and the average lateral acceleration are key performance indicators.",
    "autocross":"Autocross",
    "autocross-desc":"Evaluate the car's agility, handling, and overall dynamic performance. The car maneuvers through a tight and twisty course marked by cones. The focus is on achieving the fastest time while successfully navigating the course, emphasizing lateral and longitudinal acceleration, as well as responsiveness.",
    "endurance":"Endurance",
    "endurance-desc":"Test the car's durability, reliability, and fuel efficiency over an extended race distance. The car must complete a specified number of laps on a challenging track. The event evaluates both the vehicle's endurance and the team's strategic decisions regarding fuel efficiency, pit stops, and overall reliability.",
